## A little info. about me...

> For the last 18 years I have been teaching business English in companies as a freelance teacher. Due to the Covid-19 paddemic, I unfortunately lost most of my clients and am now looking for a new career path. I have been learning web design in my free time but now I want to take it tio the next level so I have started a Web Development course to expand my knowledge. The terminal command and Javascript are new territory for me.
