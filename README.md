## A little info about me...

I had been teaching business English in companies as a freelance teacher. Due to the Covid-19 paddemic, I unfortunately lost most of my clients and am now looking for a new career path. I have been learning web design in my free time but now I want to take it tio the next level so I am taking a full-time Web Development course with Digital Career Institute GmbH in Berlin to expand my knowledge. 

### Things I have learned so far:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Node.js
5. Express
6. MongoDB
7. React
8. Bootstrap

And whatever else becomes necessary to further develop the skills I will need to further my career. At the moment, when I have some time to spare at the weekends I am trying to become familiar with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
